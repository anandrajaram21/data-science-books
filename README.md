# Data Science Books

## Introduction
This repository contains close to 50 different data science and mathematics books, which may be of immense help to you.
All the books here were obtained from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/gzk4wz/50_free_machine_learning_and_data_science_ebooks/)

## Additional Books
These books could not be donwloaded as a PDF file as they were only available as websites. Here are the one I personally found interesting.
